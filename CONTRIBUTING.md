# Contributing to PMIP

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Property Management Integration Platform as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the package.json version following [SemVer](http://semver.org/)
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/rashidazarang/property-management-integration-platform/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/rashidazarang/property-management-integration-platform/issues/new).
